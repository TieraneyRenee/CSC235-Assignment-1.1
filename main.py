# Week 1 Assignment | Tieraney Stewart
# For this assignment we need to create a tutorial about a python feature
# This code needs to have:
#   Two Variables
#   Input and Output 
#   All the code comments

# Print out information about the print command
print('\n\nWelcome to Learning Python Because this is a Really Cool Tutorial!\n\n') # Whatever is put in the print '()' will be print out to the screen. It is a built in Python function. Single or double quotes can be used, but be consistent!
#\n is the break for Python
print ('In this lesson, we are going to master the "print" command in Python.\n\n') # Single quotation marks are good to use so that double can be used in the text that is printed out. A slash can also be used? There are different styles of doing things. Ultimately it is a personal preference.

# Create two variables 
# Gather user input
userName = input('Hello! What is your name? (Type Your Name)  ') #
readyYN = input('Are you ready? (Y/N)  ')

# Display user input
print('\n\nNice to meet you', userName)
print('You answered with:', readyYN ) # Python is case sensitive! Copy and paste variable names to be sure that everything matches up. Remember tiny details are big! 

# Print some more information about python
print('\n\nWhat do you think the "print" command in Python is?')
print('Okay! Time is up!')
print('If you thought it was "print" then you would be correct!')
print('------------')
print('\n\nHere is the syntax for the "print" command in Python')
print('print("Text to display on the screen.")')
print('------------')
print('\n\nHere is how you would use the "print" command in Python to print out the phrase "I am HAL 9000 Computer":')
print('print("I am the HAL 9000 Computer")')
print('\n\nThe following would display in your application')
print('\nI am the HAL 9000 Computer')
print('\n\nPro Tip: the print command must be all in lowercase.')

# If an error happens the given line number may not be the exact line that the error is. But this is where to start looking.

# Create the second variable
rating = input('Please rate this tutorial on a scale of 1 to 1o. (with 10 being the absolute best) ')# Adding an extra space before the last closing ' will create a little space in what is printed.
print('\nYou thought this tutorial was a: ',  rating) # With more advanced prgramming it would be possible to personalize the response that is printed depending on how the user answers.

# Consistency is important however there may be times where things may need to be done a little differently. Be sure to leave comments in these instances!

print('End of the tutorial. Have a good day!\n\n')

# Main things taken from this assignment:
#   Consistency always! If something has to be done different from how it has been done previously then be sure to leave a comment with why it had to be done. This will be improtant to prevent misunderstandings.
#   As always with coding it seems like the little details are the ones that matter the most. Pyton is case sensitive! 'Print' won't do anything at all but 'print' will.
